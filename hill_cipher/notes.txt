Hill Cipher
- Uses **matrix multiplication** over mod 26.
- A 3 x 3 Hill cipher hides single and digram frequencies.
- Breakable with known plaintext.

Formula: E(K,P) = K*P mod 26

- K is the key matrix
- P is the plaintext vector
- E(K,P) is the ciphertext vector

- The key matrix must be invertible mod 26.
- The determinant of the key matrix must be coprime to 26 (i.e., gcd(det(K), 26) = 1). 
- If the determinant is not coprime to 26, the matrix does not have an inverse mod 26, and decryption is impossible.
- The plaintext is divided into vectors of size n (where n is the size of the key matrix, e.g., 2 for a 2x2 matrix, 3 for a 3x3 matrix).
- If the length of the plaintext is not a multiple of n, it is padded with extra letters (commonly 'X') to make it fit.

- Each vector is multiplied by the key matrix, and the result is taken mod 26 to produce the ciphertext vector.
    e. Convert the ciphertext letter number back to a letter (0=A, 1=B, ..., 25=Z).
    f. Append the ciphertext letter to the ciphertext string.

7. For each letter in the ciphertext (for decryption):
   a. Convert the ciphertext letter to its corresponding number (A=0, B=1, ..., Z=25).
   b. Convert the corresponding key letter to its corresponding number (A=0, B=1, ..., Z=25).
   c. Calculate the plaintext letter number using the formula:
      p = (c - k + 26) mod 26  # Adding 26 to ensure non-negative result
    d. Convert the plaintext letter number back to a letter (0=A, 1=B, ..., 25=Z).
    e. Append the plaintext letter to the plaintext string.
8. Return the plaintext string.
   c. Calculate the plaintext letter number using the formula:
      p = (c - k + 26) mod 26  # Adding 26 to ensure non-negative result
    d. Convert the plaintext letter number back to a letter (0=A, 1=B, ..., 25=Z).
    e. Append the plaintext letter to the plaintext string.
8. Return the plaintext string.
